Backend Interview

- This line was a little ambiguous: "A module (ai_generator.py) that calls OpenAI with a structured prompt to generate a blog post draft (HTML or Markdown), replacing {{AFF_LINK_n}} placeholders with dummy URLs."
- I went with this:
  “The AI response includes affiliate placeholders like {{AFF_LINK_1}}, which the backend replaces with dummy URLs like https://dummyurl.com/a1.”
